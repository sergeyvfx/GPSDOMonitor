Upstream version: 2.2.2 (e171aa2d15e)
Local modifications:

- Flattened the tree and only included files needed for ez.

- defines.h was originally generated on linux machine with some
  further tweaks:

  * OS_WINDOWS need to be conditinally defined from inside #ifdef WIN32
  * Disabeld HAVE_FNMATCH_H
  * Same applies to HAVE_SHLWAPI_H

- config.h:
  * Forced disabled GFLAGS_IS_A_DLL

- Ifdef-ed __attribute((unused)) in gflags.h to only __GNUC__.
  This file is automatically generated when building Gflags from
  own repository, so seems there is no trick we can avoid such manual
  tweak unless we do own configuration of gflags as well.
